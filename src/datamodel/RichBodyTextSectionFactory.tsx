This site is implemented in React, primarily using <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a> for the components of the site. I used <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> for local development server setup, and hosted the site using GitHub pages, using GitHub actions to deploy the site after commits from my local machine.</p>;

However, I've always wanted a version of Football Manager for Amercian Football, and I've found existing options for this pretty underwhelming. Recently I stumbled upon <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui">.NET MAUI</a>, and wanted a project to test this out. So, I've started work on American Football Manager, which I intend to be a lightweight clone of Football Manager for American football that's implemented with .NET MAUI.</p>;
