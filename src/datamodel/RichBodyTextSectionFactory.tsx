This site is implemented in React, primarily using <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a> for the components of the site. I used <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> for local development server setup, and hosted the site using GitHub pages, using GitHub actions to deploy the site after commits from my local machine.</p>;

So, I created an app that displays that gets train timing and departure data from the VBB trainsit authority and displays this info in a user-friendly way. You can check out the pull request <a href="https://github.com/tidbyt/community/pull/2518">here</a>. This development was a great opporunity to contribute to an open source project, as well as good practice for working with RESTful APIs.</p>;
